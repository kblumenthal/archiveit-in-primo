**Background:** This solution was developed by Ex Libris for the New York Art Resources Consortium to display Archive-It results directly within the Primo user interface using the [OpenSearch API] (https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/search/OpenSearch+API).

**Process:**

> Step 1: Download the example archive-it.html file containing the javascript and CSS to call the API and display the results.
> Step 2: Edit line 173 to include the institutionâ€™s Archive-It collection numbers:


> Step 3: Save archive-it.html to the institution's Primo server under static_htmls.
